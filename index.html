          <h3>Baking</h3>
          <p>I started baking in 2020, because I had nothing better to do during the pandemic. Baking had a nice touch to it because my sister is allergic to gluten and I wanted to bake things she would be able to eat. Ever since then, I have never stopped. My best dish and all time favorite is the banana muffin.</p>

          <h3>Coding</h3>
          <p>I started coding when I was around 13 years. I only started doing so because I have always been a fan of different artists and I wanted to create a fanpage for them, but I didn't have the money to pay for someone to do it. So, I learned it by myself, stopped when I got a bit older and now I'm back at it again.</p>
